        <p>Hello friend, what I'm about to tell you is a little of myself. Currently, I am a student at CodeSkool learning how to become a Web Deveolper. I've learned many new things such as how to navigat and use multiple new commands inside of Terminal and Visual Studio Code. Personally, I am a sports fanatic and i'm completely obssessed with cars. I have a passion for reading, learning, music and photography. I'm 24 years old from Chicago, Illinois and ready to use the cities hard work ethic and no BS attitude for my next venture and what i've learned in CodeSkool, so I can walk down the bridge to success. </p>
